# MySnake

This is my own iteration of the classic Snake game

The reason I'm making this game is to:
  1) Push myself to get better at C++ in general, by working on a project with obtainable results
  2) Have a game where I can set up a Reinforcement Learning agent on top of, to improve my AI skills

As of Feb. 1st 2025, only the very main features are ready; namely moving the snake around, eating food, and ending the game when the head hits the body.
03.01.25 : Added outer walls, snake-head and wall interaction, and finally introduced an algorithm to place the food appropriately at each iteration.
