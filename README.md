# MySnake

This is my own iteration of the classic Snake game

How to play:
Get the .exe file from the directory "x64/Release/MySnake.exe"
Run the executable to start the game
Use WASD to control the snake.
The game pauses automatically when you don't press any buttons.
If you'd like to quit the game, press Q.


The reason I'm making this game is to:
  1) Push myself to get better at C++ in general, by working on a project with obtainable results
  2) Have a game where I can set up a Reinforcement Learning agent on top of, to improve my AI skills

As of Feb. 1st 2025, only the very main features are ready; namely moving the snake around, eating food, and ending the game when the head hits the body.

03.01.25 : Added outer walls, snake-head and wall interaction, and finally introduced an algorithm to place the food appropriately at each iteration.
